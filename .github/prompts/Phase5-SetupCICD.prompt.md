## 🚦 MANDATORY OPENING CHECK — Capability Matrix Required

**Before doing ANY work for Phase 5 — Setup CI/CD, verify the Discovery contract:**

| Required artifact | Location | If missing |
|-------------------|----------|------------|
| Discovery Dossier | `reports/Discovery-Dossier.md` | **STOP** — run `/assess-any-application` first |
| Capability Matrix | `reports/Capability-Matrix.yaml` | **STOP** — run `/assess-any-application` first |
| Approved Migration Plan | `reports/Migration-Plan.md` | **STOP** — run `/Phase1-Plan` (or the `/build-migration-plan` add-on) |

### If ANY of those three artifacts is missing

Reply with exactly:

```
🚨 Phase 5 — Setup CI/CD cannot proceed without the Discovery contract.

Missing artifacts:
  - reports/Discovery-Dossier.md          [missing/present]
  - reports/Capability-Matrix.yaml         [missing/present]
  - reports/Migration-Plan.md              [missing/present]

Required steps before re-running this phase:
  1. Open Copilot Chat → /assess-any-application  (or in CLI: "assess this application")
  2. Then: /Phase1-Plan                            (produces the Migration Plan, or use /build-migration-plan add-on)
  3. Then: /phase...

To override (skip Discovery and accept risk), log a waiver entry in
reports/Decision-Log.md with `Waiver: skip-discovery=<reason>` and re-invoke
this prompt with the `--accept-risk` natural-language flag in your request.
```

**Do NOT proceed past this gate unless:**
- All three artifacts exist, OR
- A waiver entry exists in `reports/Decision-Log.md` AND the user explicitly said "skip discovery" or similar

### When the gate passes

1. Read `reports/Capability-Matrix.yaml` and extract these fields you must honor:
   - `source.primary_adapter` → load the matching `source-*` skill
   - `stack.primary_stack` + `stack.secondary_stacks` → load matching `stack-*` skills
   - `workload.primary_pattern` → load matching `workload-*` skill
   - `migration_strategy.recommendation` → adjust phase emphasis based on the recommended strategy
   - `risk_flags` → load the matching risk skills (e.g., `risk-cross-region-data.md`)
   - `unresolved_questions` → if any remain unanswered, surface them BEFORE starting work
2. **Skill Gap Check (belt + suspenders)** — for each value above, verify a matching `<family>-<value>.md` exists in `.github/skills/`. If any is missing, invoke `.github/skills/skill-creator.md` to author it on the fly. Ask a single Y/n/N-for-session confirmation; default is Y.
3. Read `reports/Migration-Plan.md` for approved sequencing and any app-specific extra gates.
4. Confirm Phase prerequisites are met.

## 📜 Action Log Contract

**After each meaningful action** in this prompt, append one single-line entry to the `## 📜 Action Log` section at the bottom of `reports/Report-Status.md`.

Canonical format:
```
- <ISO-8601-UTC> | actor=Phase5-SetupCICD | action=<verb-phrase> | files=<+created,~modified,-deleted> | tokens=~<bucket> | turn=<n> | notes="<free text>"
```

Rules:
- Use `actor=Phase5-SetupCICD` for actions taken by this prompt.
- Use `actor=User` for actions taken by the user (e.g., answering a decision).
- Log **only meaningful actions**: phase transitions, artifact production, decision events, gate passes/blocks, user inputs, rollback events. Do NOT log every internal grep or file read.
- Estimate `tokens` in buckets: `~0`, `~500`, `~2k`, `~8k`, `~30k`. The `turn` counter is exact; token estimate is best-effort. Point users to Copilot Dashboard for authoritative counts.
- If `reports/Report-Status.md` doesn't exist yet, create it from `.github/skills/migration-report-template.md` first — it already includes the `## 📜 Action Log` section.

Full spec: `.github/skills/action-log-format.md`.

Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and continuous integration

## Preconditions

Before configuring CI/CD, verify Phase 4 (Deployment to Azure) is complete:

1. Check `reports/Report-Status.md` shows **Phase 4: Deployment to Azure** as ✅ complete.
2. Confirm `reports/Deployment-Summary-Report.md` exists with the deployment outcome.
3. If preconditions are not met, **STOP** and ask the user to run `/Phase4-DeployToAzure` first.

# Rules for CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Use `azure_config_deploymentpipeline` to generate deployment pipeline configurations.
- Use `file_search` to locate existing pipeline files and understand current CI/CD setup.
- Use `semantic_search` to identify deployment requirements from the application structure.
- Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines that support the target Azure platform and hosting approach.
- Create pipeline configurations that follow Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions best practices.

## CI/CD Strategy Implementation

### Pipeline Platform Selection:
- Determine whether to use GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or both
- Consider existing organizational preferences and integrations
- Evaluate security and compliance requirements
- Set up service connections and authentication

### For GitHub Actions:
- Create `.github/workflows/` directory structure
- Set up workflow files for:
  - Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline
  - Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline
  - Infrastructure deployment pipeline
  - Security scanning pipeline
- Configure GitHub secrets for Azure authentication
- Set up environment protection rules
- Configure branch protection policies

### For Azure DevOps:
- Create Azure DevOps project and repository connections
- Set up build pipelines (azure-pipelines.yml)
- Configure release pipelines for deployment
- Set up service connections to Azure
- Configure variable groups and secure variables
- Set up approval processes and gates

## Pipeline Configuration Details

### Continuous Integration Pipeline:
# Include the following stages:
- Source code checkout and caching
- Dependency installation and caching
- Code quality analysis (SonarQube, ESLint, etc.)
- Security scanning (Snyk, OWASP dependency check)
- Unit test execution with coverage reporting
- Integration test execution
- Application build and packaging
- Container image build and security scanning (if applicable)
- Artifact publishing to registry
- Infrastructure validation (Bicep/Terraform linting)

### Continuous Deployment Pipeline:
# Include the following stages:
- Environment-specific configuration
- Infrastructure deployment (using azd or direct ARM/Bicep)
- Application deployment to staging environment
- Smoke tests and health checks
- Integration tests against staging
- Security tests and compliance validation
- Performance tests and baseline validation
- Production deployment with approval gates
- Post-deployment validation and monitoring
- Rollback procedures in case of failures

## Environment Management:

### Multi-Environment Setup:
- Configure development, staging, and production environments
- Set up environment-specific configurations and secrets
- Implement environment promotion strategies
- Configure environment isolation and security
- Set up monitoring and logging for each environment

### Infrastructure as Code Integration:
- Integrate Bicep/Terraform deployment in pipelines
- Set up infrastructure validation and testing
- Configure infrastructure drift detection
- Implement infrastructure rollback procedures
- Set up infrastructure security scanning

## Deliverables:

- Generate a CI/CD setup report in the 'reports' folder, named 'cicd_setup_report.md', including:
  - Pipeline architecture and configuration details
  - Environment setup and management procedures
  - Security and compliance integration
  - Quality gates and approval processes
  - Monitoring and observability setup
  - Performance optimization configurations
  - Operational procedures and troubleshooting guides
  - Cost optimization strategies
  - Training and documentation resources

- Create actual pipeline configuration files in the appropriate directories:
  - `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions
  - `azure-pipelines.yml` for Azure DevOps
  - Environment-specific configuration files
  - Security scanning configurations

- If CI/CD setup fails at any step, provide detailed error analysis and alternative approaches.
- Make the CI/CD report human-readable and in markdown format with clear sections and actionable guidance.
- Suggest that the migration and modernization process is now complete! Mention `/GetStatus` to review the final status and next steps for ongoing maintenance and optimization.
- At the end, update the status report file reports/Report-Status.md with the status of the CI/CD step and mark the overall migration process as successfully completed.

## Next Steps

When CI/CD setup is complete:

1. ✅ Update `reports/Report-Status.md` to mark **Phase 5: CI/CD Setup** as complete and the overall migration as successfully completed.
2. 🎉 Output the following completion block to the user:

   > **🎉 Migration Complete!**
   >
   > The migration and modernization process is now complete.
   >
   > 📋 Run **`/GetStatus`** to review the final status and recommended ongoing maintenance.
